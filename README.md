Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Term 1 project 3: Investigate a dataset using Python

In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigated it using NumPy and Pandas. I completed the entire data analysis process, from starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.
The purpose of this project was to learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data.
